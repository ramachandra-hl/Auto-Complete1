# AutoQA-Complete

**AutoQA-Complete** is an automation framework designed to streamline and automate the testing of the **Spacecraft** application. The framework supports the creation, management, and testing of modules through API and UI testing methods. Our goal is to automate the entire **Spacecraft** application workflow, and in future iterations, extend this automation to include the **Homelane** website and **Roaster** platform.

## Features

  - Add and manage new modules.
  - Generate multiple files via API and UI-based testing.
  
- **API & UI Testing**: Use comprehensive testing strategies to validate both API calls and UI functionality.
  - Verify API responses for module generation and interaction.
  - Ensure that UI changes are captured and tested thoroughly.

- **Scalable Automation**: The framework will expand to support additional applications, such as:
  - **Homelane** website automation.
  - **Roaster** platform automation.

## Future Scope

1. **Homelane Website**:
   - Integrating automation workflows for the Homelane website.
   - Covering essential functionalities such as customer interaction, data management, and more.

2. **Roaster Platform**:
   - Automating the testing of the Roaster platform, ensuring optimal performance and functionality.
